In total, over 100 scouts and talent evaluators showed up.</p><p>Concerns about his draft range have stemmed from his age and injury history, as he's older than other top quarterback prospects such as 22-year-old Caleb Williams and 21-year-old Drake Maye. Penix Jr. also dealt with multiple torn ACL injuries in college, which may cause front offices to question his durability.</p><p>Still, his performance on Thursday combined with his 2023 production could be enough to warrant a first-round selection.</p><p>He's coming off a phenomenal senior campaign with the Huskies, completing 65.4 percent of his throws for 4,903 yards and 36 touchdowns compared to 11 interceptions. It marked the second consecutive year in which he surpassed 4,600 yards and 30 touchdown passes.</p><p>However, it's clear that at least one NFL coach believes that he won't have to wait until Day 2 in order to hear his name called.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGlpYWmEeIWMp52lZZOkrqS0jKagnKCRmrluvMSnoLFlmqd6rbvCpJydZZmjenK%2F02apqK2embKzecinZGtoYml6pb7An6tmmZapsrN5z6umZpyRrg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
