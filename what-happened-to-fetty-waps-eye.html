The New Jersey rapper only has one eye, his right eye. A physical characteristic that has provoked the curiosity of fans.
What happened to Fetty Wap’s eye? Born Willie Junior Maxwell II on 7 June, 1991, the 30-year-old lost his left eye shortly before his first birthday. He kept the cause of this under wraps for a long time until early 2015."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

That’s it. That’s the story.”</p><h2>What has Fetty Wap said about his eye?</h2><p>Many would be unsettled and distressed by the loss of their eye.</p><p>But don’t think that is the case of Fetty.</p><p>In that same 2015 interview, the Trap Queen rapper made it cleat that he had no qualms about it.</p><p>“I’m probably one of the first <a href=#>rappers</a>/singers to come on the scene with one eye and be comfortable with it”, he told DJ Self.</p><p>He then went on to talk about people’s reactions to him loosing his eye at an early age.</p><p>“A lot of people are judgemental, but it’s all on how you show yourself to the people.”</p><p>“That’s probably one of the main things people won’t know about me until they see me.”</p><p>Although he was provided with a prosthetic eye following the incident, Fetty decided to get rid of it during his teenage years, after becoming more and more comfortable with his disability.</p><p><span class=article__bc_video-caption>Tupac fans spread conspiracy rapper is ALIVE after TikTok lookalike emerges 25 years after his death</span></p><p><a href=#>This post first appeared on Thesun.co.uk</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue82erqxnp52utXnHmqepnZ6asW7Azmadnqykrnq4rc%2BsZJ6xlWQ%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
