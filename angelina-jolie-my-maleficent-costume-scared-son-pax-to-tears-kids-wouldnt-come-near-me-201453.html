In the March 8 issue of Entertainment Weekly, <a href=#><strong>Angelina Jolie</strong></a> reveals the real reason her 5-year-old daughter <strong>Vivienne </strong>was cast as the young Princess Aurora in her upcoming Disney thriller Maleficent — her role as the titular villain scared other children!</p><p>"We think it's fun for our kids to have cameos and join us on set, but not to be actors. That's not our goal for <a href=#><strong>Brad</strong></a> [<strong>Pitt</strong>] and I at all," Jolie, 38, explained of raising her six children with fiance Pitt. "But the other 3-and 4-year-old [performers] wouldn't come near me. It had to be a child that liked me and wasn't afraid of my horns and my eyes and my claws. So it had to be Viv."</p><p>Specifically daughter Vivian because her other children — <a href=#><strong>Maddox</strong></a>, 12,<strong> Pax</strong>, 10, <strong>Zahara</strong>, 9, <a href=#><strong>Shiloh</strong></a>, 7, and Vivienne's twin brother <strong>Knox</strong> — were also terrified of their mom in costume.</p><p>"When Pax saw me for the first time, he ran away and got upset — and I thought he was kidding, so I was pretending to chase him until I actually found him crying," Jolie recalled. "I had to take off pieces [of the makeup] in front of him to show him it was all fake and not freak out so much."</p><p>After Jolie's children told her not to play the villain in the movie, the actress tried to change their minds by sharing a more sympathetic side to her "Mistress of All Evil" character.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>"I said, 'Let me tell you the real story but you can't tell anybody,'" she recalled. "So this was my test too, like any parent. The next day, I heard Shiloh getting into a fight with another kid, defending Maleficent, saying, 'You don't understand her!' They got into a bit of an argument and I thought, that's the reason to do the film."</p><p>Jolie explained: "When that character makes mistakes — which Maleficent does, and crosses many lines — you want them to be angry at her and concerned and confused and in the end, somehow understand something that they didn't know before."</p><p>The speech to her kids worked, and Pax and Zahara also had cameo appearances in the film during the christening scene, when Maleficent places a curse on Aurora. "I had to walk by them being very mean," Jolie said. "Of course, I wanted to stop and wink at them."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGicp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX6OyuL%2BOmqWgnZyeu6J5yaijop1dosZuucClnJ%2Bhk5q7tXnCqKqtrZ2aerSvwKucnWWjpLtuvMCxZK2nXamyor7SZqKinKNixLDBy52lrWWTpLqmec2emKtlnZp6c3yQbWxs</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
