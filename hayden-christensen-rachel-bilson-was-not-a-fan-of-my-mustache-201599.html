Uh, facial hair isn’t really my thing. I don’t grow it very well. That was a good two months of commitment.”</p><p>Even then, he needed some help. “Yeah, there was a little bit of makeup… to make it look a little thicker, but the real Don Piper had a pretty hefty mustache,” baby <strong>Briar Rose’</strong>s dad mused of his character. “It wasn’t necessarily my thing, it itched a lot. I’m very happy to shave it off.”</p><p><img decoding=async width=467 height=291 src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all" alt="Hayden Christensen with Moustache" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>His longtime girlfriend Bilson was just as relieved, he revealed to HuffPost. “She was very happy for me to get rid of it.

The character she plays is such an amazing character, and she’s really the hero of the story, and I just wanted to be a part of a movie that was part of telling a good story.”</p><p>Watch the video above!</p><p><strong>Have a question you’d like to ask a celebrity?
