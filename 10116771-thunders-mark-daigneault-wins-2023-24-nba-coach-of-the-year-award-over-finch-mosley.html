That was an incredible accomplishment in itself after the rebuilding franchise won just 46 games (and lost 108) over the previous two seasons combined.</p><p>Hopes were greater in 2023-24, especially with the impending debut of big man Chet Holmgren, the No. 2 overall pick in the NBA draft who missed all of last year with a Lisfranc injury. Still, the Thunder weren't expected to make a massive leap of the standings just yet.</p><p>However, OKC emerged as a championship contender, finishing 57-25 and earning the top seed in the Western Conference playoffs. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander played at an MVP level once again, while Holmgren was one of the top rookies in the league all season. Jaylin Williams also developed into a bona fide star as well alongside those two.</p><p>Most importantly, this Thunder team exhibited great on- and off-court <a href=# rel=noopener>chemistry</a> all year. It was commonplace to see teammates crowd around one being interviewed postgame for their exploits, and everyone seemed to genuinely get along and like each other.</p><p>Although the team has a clear star and then two other great talents for a big three, the entire roster coalesced and fared well when called upon.</p><p>Daigneault, who coached the G League's Oklahoma City Blue for five seasons before joining the Thunder, led this great team, and him winning the Coach of the Year was a no-brainer after guiding the 17-win improvement. In a Western Conference that features an impressive array of All-Star talents, OKC flew to the top of the league.</p><p>It's a great accomplishment for the 39-year-old Daigneault, who is the youngest head coach to win the honor since 39-year-old Mike Fratello did so for the 1985-86 Cleveland Cavaliers.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGlpYWuEeH2MrZ%2BuppSav7R5zJqppGWUlraousSarKWsXay2r7%2BMa2dra11ngW66wZpknKeRmLVuu8Vmq6GdXa6yor6Mmq6aqpRivLex0WadoqaTnXquu9KlnLI%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
