Wiki Bio</span></h2><p>Daniel Nwosu Jr. was born in Ottawa, Canada on 22 March 1994 so under the zodiac sign of Aries and holding Canadian nationality – as DAX, his career of a rapper and a YouTuber is what has made him popular.</p><h2><span id=Education_and_early_life>Education and early life</span></h2><p>DAX hasn’t talked much about his family, as he prefers to keep them away from the media’s attention – he hasn’t mentioned having any siblings, which is why most people believe him to be an only child.</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/ByvlGnjgS3r/</p><p>DAX spent his entire childhood in Ottawa, and was not interested in rap as he was growing-up, but was rather sporting and was an aspiring basketball player.

After he matriculated, he went on to attend Sunrise Christian Academy where he was named the most valuable player (MVP) in basketball – he then moved to play for Casper College, before switching to the University of Montana and finally graduating from Newman University.</p><p>While he was studying at Newman University, DAX was working as a janitor so that he could financially support himself.</p><h2><span id=DAXs_rap_career_and_other_works>DAX’s rap career and other works</span></h2><p>DAX was very interested in spoken-word poetry during the years he spent at college, and was also a motivational speaker – he eventually decided to combine these elements into his career of a rapper.</p><p>Some of the first songs DAX has recorded and uploaded on the internet were “Black in America”, “Hilly Hilly Hilly Clinton”, “The Basketball Song”, and “My President Bad and Boujee”.

They have allegedly been together ever since, and have split only once for unknown reasons, however, nothing about this relationship has been confirmed by DAX.</p><p>During the five months he spent apart from his girlfriend, he is said to have been dating a popular female rap star which was allegedly the reason behind his initial split with his current girlfriend.
