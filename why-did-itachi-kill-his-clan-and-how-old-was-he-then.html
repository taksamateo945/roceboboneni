Driven by a complex web of motivations and circumstances, Itachi made the heart-wrenching decision to eliminate his family, opting for a path of sacrifice to protect his village from an impending Uchiha rebellion.

One of such very difficult decisions was killing Izumi, who is regarded as his girlfriend. Izumi was a member of the Uchiha family. Everyone in his clan, including her, had to be wiped out. That was a prerequisite for ending the rebellion.<br></span></p><p class=p3><span class=s2>Itachi resolved to kill Izumi first because there was no going back after that. He crept into her residence and performed a Tsukuyomi on Izumi. In that illusion, she had a happy life with Itachi, where they were married and had children. The same delusion led to her falling ill and dying on her deathbed.<br></span></p><p class=p3><span class=s2>Itachi resolved to take advantage of the timing and kill her right there and then. He was compelled to kill Izumi because she was a member of the Uchiha clan, but he did so gently. This was a strong indicator of his feelings for Izumi, and it appears that he was deeply saddened by his actions. </span>He seemed to care deeply for Izumi and to adore her. However, he had to choose between starting a war and murdering his clan.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaqaG2r7HRZ5qopV%2Bstbp5w6KbZqGklrCptYykoKWkXZ22tHnCpZinZZGjsW60zrBkqKSUYsSiv4yhnGasmJq7cA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
