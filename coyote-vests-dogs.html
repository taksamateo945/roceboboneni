The vest is made from Kevlar, the same puncture-resistant material used by law enforcement, and fitted with spikes on the neck and sides to prevent bites. But its most unique feature, perhaps, is the "coyote whiskers"—bright nylon bristles attached to the back which make the dog appear larger and more threatening to animals looking for their next meal.</p><p>While coyotes are around all the time, they tend to be most visible during their mating season, which runs from late December to March, which is why this is the best time to put on the vest.</p><p>And while it's certainly functional, people can't help but notice that they have the added benefit of making the dogs look super punk rock.</p><p>This precious little lady is channeling some major Jared Leto vibes.</p><p>Lola is just about ready to buy a leather jacket and rebel against mainstream culture.</p><p>And Charlie, well, he's mostly in this for the crowd-surfing.</p><p>In fact, some humans can't help but wonder whether or not they come in adult human sizes.</p><p>Especially since cyclists in Australia actually wear a version of this as helmets to protect themselves from magpies—a type of bird that sometimes swoops down on an unsuspecting target and attacks their head.</p><p>As funny as coyote vests look, they have a sad backstory, as they were invented in 2014 by San Diego resident <strong>Paul Mott</strong> after his dog was attacked and dragged off by a coyote, never to be seen again. Based on the testimonials, it seems like these vests are pretty effective at warding off potential attackers. And if you can protect your best friend and make them look metal at the same time, it's just an added bonus.<span aria-hidden=true>ae0fcc31ae342fd3a1346ebb1f342fcb</span></p><p>And for more tips on how to shield your dog from harm, check out this <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>expert advice on what to do with your pup during a natural disaster</a>.</p><p><i>To discover more amazing secrets about living your best life,&nbsp;</i><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span class=s1><i>click here</i></span></a><i>&nbsp;to follow us on Instagram!&nbsp;&nbsp;</i></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmialajBrbXFnqanpJmjsm%2BvzqZmnKeppMGmedWeqq2rXZm8qL%2BO</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
