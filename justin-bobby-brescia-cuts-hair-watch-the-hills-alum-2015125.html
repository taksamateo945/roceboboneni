Consider this your deleted scene. As for the big question: Did the label-hating Brescia ever actually date Patridge?</p><p>“There were some points,” he admitted. “We worked so much together for such a long time that we’d work all these hours and then we’d go have dinner and do things together, but our schedules kind of collided.”</p><p>Watch the rest of the clip to see the finished product!&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGicp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX6OyuL%2BOo6ysrJmjeqO7wZuwZpqimsCktcBmmq6so2K1orXRZq6arJOderW0xGafoqScqHqiuNSmZGtoYWp%2Bc4E%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
