The 29-year-old Made in Chelsea star got candid about her troubled childhood, revealing that she struggled with crystal meth addiction at an early age.&nbsp;</p><p>“I was 14 or 15 [when I first smoked it],” she wrote in her book (via the <a href=#>Daily Mail</a>). “I was on the extreme level and addiction developed instantly. [I smoked] probably four times before school, then at snack… probably 12 or 13 times a day.”&nbsp;</p><p>The younger sister of notorious reality TV villain <strong>Spencer Pratt </strong>struggled with addiction to both meth and cocaine throughout her childhood, noting her parents turned their heads to her issues.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all"><p>“I didn’t care about anything. I could live or die, I didn’t care,” she said. “I had nothing to get out of bed for, nothing was exciting.”</p><p>In 2006, Pratt was arrested for attempting to steal $4,000 worth of designer clothes while on drugs.&nbsp;</p><p>“I woke up handcuffed to a hospital bed. When I landed back in L.A., Mom took me back home and I went upstairs to my old bedroom and I felt so much shame,” she recalled.&nbsp;</p><p>Things turned around when she joined the cast of The Hills in 2007. Stephanie worked hard to stay sober, despite the party environment portrayed on the reality series.&nbsp;</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>But her addiction to drugs morphed into insecurities about her weight as she was surrounded by her stick-thin costars. She became bulimic during her three years on the show.&nbsp;</p><p>“I lost about six pounds in two weeks but bulimia made my face very puffy so I freaked out and began going on crazy little diets, like I’d only eat Tic Tacs,” Stephanie wrote. By 2009 she weighed 105 pounds.&nbsp;</p><p>Fortunately, Stephanie recovered and now leads a clean and healthy life. Her debut memoir, Made in Reality, was released on Aug. 13.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpZ6vo2S7psPSaKqtnaCdrq%2B1xGanq5mkqXq0uc6knJ1lk6fGtMDApWSmnaSdenJ%2FjK2gpp2jYrGixYyanp5lYWl6c3yQbmhxcA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
