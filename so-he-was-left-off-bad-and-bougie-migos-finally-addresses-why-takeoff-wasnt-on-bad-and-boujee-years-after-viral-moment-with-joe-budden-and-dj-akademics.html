In a teaser clip for the upcoming episode of “Rap Radar,” co-host Elliott Wilson posed the question to Takeoff, asking the rapper: Was there something about ‘Bad and Boujee?’ Why you didn’t wanna rap on that beat?

We was actually pissed off because we ain’t have no music out. I think like a couple months before that whole little wave, and we was going through the litigation with 300 [Entertainment], so we ended up leaking ‘Bad and Boujee’ on SoundCloud first.”</p><p>The 31-year-old also noted that they were under pressure with limited time to work and that he almost didn’t make the quadruple platinum track. “S–t, I wasn’t even finna be on it,” the rapper revealed. “I had to do my verse on some quick, fast, in-a-rush s–t. So it was just like everybody running to the song and trying to get it done.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Respectfully. <a href=#>@QuavoStuntin</a> + <a href=#>@1YoungTakeoff</a> <a href=#>#RapRadarPodcast</a> 🔊🔊 8.18 <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/pLmbdoITcq</a></p>— Elliott Wilson (@ElliottWilson) <a href=#>August 16, 2022</a></figure><p>The last time the question was brought up was on the red carpet at the 2017 BET Awards, where “Everyday Struggle​​” <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">DJ Akademiks</a> initially inquired about the matter, asking Takeoff, “I feel like that’s a running joke, with you being left off ‘Bad and Boujee,’” Akademiks said.

However, others quickly intervened.</p><p>Fans on social media reacted to the clip while reflecting on the viral moment, including one Instagram user who wrote, “so he WAS left off bad and bougie.” Another person added, “Lmaooo this whole interview was funny asf and went left quickly.” “To this day “well wrap it up then” lives rent free in my head,” added a third person.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZpKGur8DAm6Oam5uowaK%2BjZympmdiZX9ze49xZmpxX6i8brTEZq6aq12hsqfAjKidn2WSlrFurc2dZJunpZy2pnnMop6oq12btq%2Bty6WwZpmUmb%2Bmv9KeqmavmK56ta3Knqafnl2srrS602amp2WSlrFurc2dZJunpZ%2BypnnYnpirq12Ws7Wx0WatoqqRoXquu8yepa1lp57BqXnJqJxmmqWZsaa6jJqlnWWUn3qit8CdnKahk6h8</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
