The two eloped in Las Vegas and went on to welcome daughter Zoe in December 1988. They parted ways in 1993 but remained amicable. Bonet went on to marry Game of Thrones star<strong> Jason Momoa</strong>, and welcomed a son <strong>Nakoa-Wolf</strong>, now 6, and daughter<strong> Lola</strong>, now 7, with the actor. Lenny has not been married again, but dated <strong>Vanessa Paradis </strong>in the 1990s and <strong>Nicole Kidman</strong> in the mid-2000s, and was engaged for a short time to <strong>Adriana Lima</strong> in the early 2000s.&nbsp;</p><p>“I think I’m lucky having parents that have been in show business for a while and they don’t care about the shiny stuff so much,” <a href=#>Zoe told Indiewire in December 2012 of her parents</a>. “They raised me in that way — to stay grounded, not to chase the shiny pretty things. I stay in the moment, because when you do that the hype goes away.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpZ6vo2S7psPSaLGonV2gv6LCyK2xZqCZqcBuucStZKCZnJZ6uLXToWSdoaakv6Sxw2ajnqaernqsvsCvoK2yXaG2tK2Mm6annaRivaqvjGtnam1lag%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
