But thanks to her background of dating A-list actors, we’ve been able to keep track of her romantic affiliations. So, has she ever tried dating a girl in the past? <strong>Let’s take a look at the list of Lizzie’s ex-lovers:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Boyd Holbrook </strong>(2012-2015): Her romance with Boyd was Lizzie’s first-ever publicized relationship that almost made it into marriage. They met while filming Very Good Girls and both developed feelings for each other over time. Three years later, the two broke up for reasons undisclosed – but according to Boyd, the whole thing was devastating. Apparently, Lizzie called him up on the same day that his best friend died and ended things between them. Yikes!</li><li><strong>Tom Hiddleston</strong> (2015): Interestingly, the two Marvel stars actually dated while filming a non-MCU film called I Saw The Light. In the movie, Tom and Lizzie were playing husband-and-wife. And just like their character’s fate, the two never had their happily ever after as they split just months into dating.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Robbie Arnett</strong> (2017-2021): Robbie and Lizzie started dating sometime in 2017 after they met in Mexico for a vacation. Both of them have been tight-lipped about their relationship. However, reports claim that they <a href=#>have secretly married in 2020.</a></li></ul><p>Aside from Lizzie’s official lovers, many men have also been rumored to be her boyfriends such as Chris Evans and Alexander Skarsgard.&nbsp;</p><p>As you can see, there’s no sign of Lizzie ever getting into a relationship with a girl. Although, some say that she’s secretly in love with on-screen BFF and Ingrid Goes West co-star Aubrey Plaza.</p><p>However, there’s no evidence to suggest that they are more than just friends – well, aside from a few fan-made edits posted on YouTube. People seem to ship Aubrey and Lizzie!</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span id=Elizabeth_Olsen_is_Gay_According_to_the_Public><strong>Elizabeth Olsen is Gay According to the Public</strong></span></h2><p>Sure, the public’s opinion isn’t relevant to a person’s sexual orientation. But for the sake of research, listening to what the people have to say about it is worth considering.&nbsp;</p><p>According to gay-or-straight.com, a popular website that lets people vote whether or not they think a celebrity is gay, <strong>around 797 voters think that Lizzie is gay.</strong> They account for 67% of the votes.</p><p><strong>However, it may be important to note that the average gay-rating on the website is 69%, </strong>which means that even with a 67% rating, Lizzie is straighter than most celebrities.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span id=What_is_Elizabeth_Olsens_Response_to_Gay_Rumors><strong>What is Elizabeth Olsen’s Response to Gay Rumors?</strong></span></h2><p>In true<a href=#> Elizabeth Olsen</a> fashion, the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">WandaVision </a>star has not actually responded to any gay rumors hurled at her. This isn’t a surprise, though, since she’s a very private person. Announcing <strong>your sexuality to the world is probably not something that Lizzie is fond of doing.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>For now, we’d love to hear your thoughts. Do you think Lizzie is gay or not?
