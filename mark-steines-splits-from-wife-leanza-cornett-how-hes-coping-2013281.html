"That's how he's living everything."</p><p>The single star took the boys to work on Friday, Jan. 25, to watch a segment he taped with a stuntman who demonstrated how to break a chair on someone's back. The trio had so much fun they decided to recreate the trick themselves. "Over the weekend they went to Michael's and bought balsa wood to make their own breakaway chairs," the source reveals. "The boys loved breaking the chair over their dad's back."</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>According to the source, Steines is doing everything possible to ensure his sons get through their parents' separation unscathed. "This is a difficult transition," the source explains.
