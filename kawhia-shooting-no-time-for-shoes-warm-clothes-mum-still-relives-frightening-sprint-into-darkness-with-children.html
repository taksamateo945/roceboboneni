A young mother remains haunted from having to lower her two children out of a bedroom window and sprint across farmland into the darkness after a group of armed men burst into their home.
Kawhia mum Taryn Williams didn’t have time for shoes or to wrap her children in warm clothing after being assaulted by the intruders nearly three years ago."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

The group fled as Williams fired several shots into the darkness, hitting each of them and one fatally.</p><p>Noorland urged the judge adopt a similar starting point of his co-accused of between 9 and a half and 10 years and also pointed to Toilolo’s criminal history in Australia before he was deported back to New Zealand and carried out this offending soon after.</p><p>Toilolo’s counsel, Charles Bean, was unsuccessful at trial in submitting his client didn’t enter the house, with Judge Down reconfirming that it was his footprint that was found on a door.</p><p>Bean asked the judge to come to an end jail term of four years after taking into account his remorse, his youth, and contents of his S27 cultural report.</p><p>However, Judge Down struggled to find any remorse, instead from what he had read, Toilolo had expressed more sorrow for the loss of his friend.</p><p>“None of this would have happened if Mr Toilolo and his mates had not invaded [Williams’] house that night.</p><p>“Toilolo received a gunshot to his abdomen but has made a full recovery. Another person suffered a permanent arm injury, and another a permanent leg injury.</p><p>“It’s plain from the reports that Mr Toilolo is traumatised himself … it doesn’t help to point out that was brought on by their own actions.”</p><p>In jailing Toilolo for seven years, the judge also accepted the Crown’s submission to also hand down a minimum non-parole period of 50 per cent, just like his co-offenders.</p><p>“Frankly, it’s more necessary when you look at the two co-offenders because they did show remorse and showed it properly by pleading guilty.</p><p>“Mr Toilolo has not done so … he has therefore displayed that he is not remorseful and that he presents an ongoing and continuing danger to the public.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.nzherald.co.nz/resizer/8UlrfAuyq3bUdGPk7xtPbHN6aiI=/16x2/smart/filters:quality(70)/cloudfront-ap-southeast-2.images.arcpublishing.com/nzme/CU5UYZLMKC5RUXEXKBQIISNPVY.jpg"><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue82erqxnm5bEqbXAZqqhp5%2Bptq%2BzjKemZqyZorJuss6rZKygn5rAbsPAq6Rmm5ykwamx0makrqVdqMGquMtmqZ6kmauytHnFq6CgoKSau6q6xmaqqaqZo8Futc2tpmackae4r7HSrGSwoaSdeqS0yKWbq52eZA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
