Residents in Auckland’s Te Atatū were left feeling scared as police swarmed in on a local sports club as a “disorder” incident unfolded.
Police were called to the incident at Te Atatū Rugby League Club, home of the Te Atatū Roosters, on Titoki St last night – and initial reports suggested there had been a stabbing."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

At first I thought it might have been an escaped prisoner so we locked our doors and stayed inside,” she said.</p><p>Shortly after Wilson went back outside to have a look and noticed a line-up of police officers across the road closer to Toru St.</p><p>“There were lots of police, they had guns and dogs,” she said.</p><p>At one point the helicopter also shone its light into the window of her house, said Wilson.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue82erqxnoKS5qq%2FEZqqwmaKieqq6jKilZpyZqLyzsMSrZKKmk56xprrTZpitZaOlvLPA0maapa2SYr%2Bwu8ysZKKmXayytMCMmqyco5yWu6V50p6tnqqRoXqivtGeqq2dlGQ%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
