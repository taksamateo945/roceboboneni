And it turns out, there are hundreds of games for couples created with the intention of teaching partners more about each other in exciting ways. To make the most of your next game night, we suggest picking up one of these games for couples as soon as possible.</p><p><img decoding=async fetchpriority=high width=1196 height=1200 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/03/ive-never-board-game.jpg alt="I've Never... board games for couples" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><h3>The Best Game for Couples on a Group Date: I've Never…</h3><p>$15.95; buy now at <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>amazon.com</a></p><p>Bring this game along on your next group date night to take the conversation to the next level. To play I've Never…, it's important to have an open mind (and a bottle of wine or two). This game for couples is equipped with prompt cards featuring a range of phrases like "I've never picked my nose in the car" and "I've never <span data-href=https://bestlifeonline.com/shower-sex/>had sex in the pool</span> or ocean," and is designed to help you spill your secrets.&nbsp;If you've done whatever is printed on the prompt card, you move forward a space&nbsp;on the board.</p><p><img decoding=async width=1153 height=1200 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/03/love-jenga-game.jpg alt="Love Jenga board games for couples" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><h3>Best Game for Couples Who Love Bar Games: Love Jenga</h3><p>$26.72; buy now at <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>aliexpress.com</a></p><p>If you're looking for a more typical game night experience, simply purchase Love Jenga—the romantic rendition of the game-night staple. Rather than simply ensuring that your tower doesn't tumble to the ground, couples playing Love Jenga will have to complete the tasks written on each Jenga piece that they remove from the tower. Since the tasks in question range from romantic to friendly, it's the perfect game for you and your partner to play with a number of different guests.</p><p><img decoding=async width=1200 height=1200 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/03/tabletopics-couples-game.jpg alt="TableTopics Couples board games for couples" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><h3>Best Game for Couples Who Want to Ask Questions: TableTopics: Couples</h3><p>$25; buy now at <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>tabletopics.com</a></p><p>Whether you just started dating or have been <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>married for years</a>, this game for couples has the ability to pose new questions and conversations for you and your partner. Equipped with 135 questions like "What possession of your partner's would you like to throw away?" and "If we could quit our jobs, what would we like to do?", this card game comes with an instruction booklet that shows couples how to play in a variety of ways—and can help them learn more about each other as individuals and as a team.</p><p><img decoding=async width=1200 height=1200 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/03/you-think-you-know-me-game.jpg alt="you think you know me board games for couples" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><h3>Best Game for Couples Who Think They Know Each Other: You Think You Know Me</h3><p>$30; <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>uncommongoods.com</a></p><p>This game forces couples to ask each other "Who even are you?" With 500 cards that contain incomplete statements like "I know your favorite color is _" and "I know it's easy/hard for you to talk about your feelings", couples will learn so much about each other in a short amount of time. Players take turns guessing what the other person will say before they answer the questions for themselves. The player who correctly anticipates the highest number of questions wins.</p><p><img decoding=async width=1200 height=1200 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/03/monogamy-board-game.jpg alt="Monogamy board games for couples" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><h3>Best Game for Couples Who Love Board Games: Monogamy</h3><p>$26.95; buy now at <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>ebay.com</a></p><p>Similar to other board games, Monogamy was created to foster communication between players. But this is a game designed only for you and your partner, as many of the game's prompts involve intimate activities like kissing, drinking, and <span data-href=https://bestlifeonline.com/sex-games/>removing articles of clothing</span>. To play Monogamy, the players move a playing piece around the board and land on squares that contain actions like looking into each other's eyes or taking a card from the deck that asks a question about the relationship. Every time you complete a circle on the board, you move up a level to more daring actions and questions. In short: the fun never ends.</p><p><img decoding=async width=1200 height=909 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/03/match-mate-board-game.jpg alt="Match Mate board games for couples" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span aria-hidden=true>ae0fcc31ae342fd3a1346ebb1f342fcb</span></p><h3>Best Game for Couples on a Double Date: Match Mate</h3><p>$49.85; buy now at <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>amazon.com</a></p><p>Ideally, it's best to play this game with two or four other couples. To play Match Mate, sit each couple across from one another. Then, give each person sitting on the same side of the table a wipe-off game folder and marker. One person will act as a scorekeeper as the people sitting on the opposite side of those with the game folder and marker will read out the four questions on the first card that they pick up from the deck. Those with the folder and marker will then write down their answer to the question—then, once they have written the question down, their partner will reveal their answer out loud. Basically, the couple who has the most in common (i.e. provides the same answers) wins the game.</p><p><img decoding=async width=1200 height=1200 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/03/fog-of-love-board-game.jpeg alt="Fog of Love board games for couples" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><h3>Best Game for Couples Who Love to Tell Stories: Fog of Love</h3><p>$15; buy now at <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>walmart.com</a></p><p>Fog of Love isn't tailored specifically for heterosexual couples. In fact, the creators of the game even released multiple versions of the box to make it more inclusive. To play, you and your partner create fictional characters who meet, fall in love, and face the challenges of modern romance. You choose six personality traits and shared goals for your characters—and go in with the knowledge that you'll inevitably have to decide whether or not your characters should continue to date. Since it was released a few years ago, Fog of Love has been the talk of the board game community.<img decoding=async width=1200 height=1200 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/03/marital-bliss-game.jpg alt="Marital Bliss board games for couples" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><h3>Best Game for Couples Who Love the Little Things: Marital Bliss</h3><p>$14.95; buy now at <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>uncommongoods.com</a></p><p>This game is played over the course of a week. At the beginning of the week, you both secretly choose missions to complete (for example, relinquishing the remote to your partner or doing the dishes). Then, the game is for your significant other to guess the special missions that you completed that week. Whoever can provide the highest number of correct guesses wins. Finally, a game that makes it easier for you to <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>do sweet things for the person</a> who deserves it most.</p><p><img decoding=async width=1200 height=1200 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/03/spouse-ology-board-game.jpeg alt="Spouse-ology board games for couples" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><h3>Best Game for Couples Who Love Game Shows: Spouse-ology</h3><p>$19.94; buy now at <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>amazon.com</a></p><p>Again, you'll need a few teams of couples for this game. Played in a similar fashion as the popular show&nbsp;The Newlywed Game, Spouse-ology challenges the idea that couples already know everything there is to learn about each other. Basically, you roll a dice that determines the category that you'll play within, and if your partner manages to guess your answer to the question provided on the prompt, then you win points that contribute to your final total.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/03/lust-board-game-for-couples.jpg alt="Lust board games for couples" width=1024 height=1268 sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><h3>Best Game for Couples Looking to Spice Things Up: Lust</h3><p>$7.59; buy now at <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>amazon.com</a></p><p>Created specifically for couples who are <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>looking to spice things up in the bedroom</a>, Lust: The Passionate Game For Two is one of the best games for couples who are looking to spark ideas for new sexual experiences.
