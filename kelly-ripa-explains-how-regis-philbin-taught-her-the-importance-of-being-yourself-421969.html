Kelly went on to say she even thought it could’ve been an incorrect report, and maybe it would later turn out to be untrue.</p><p>Regis was really good at making everyone on the program the star of the show, the host explained. Ripa also commemorated Regis during Monday’s episode of Live With Kelly and Ryan. She explained how there are certain things in life that are inevitable, specifically, death, but with Regis, it just seemed like he would find a way around it.</p><p>Furthermore, Ripa touched on his death once again in an Instagram post in which she explained how she and Ryan were very sad to hear the news. Kelly described him as a “class act” and his legacy would live on for a long time.</p><p>Fans of Ripa know she replaced <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kathie Lee Gifford back in 2001</a>. The show’s name changed to Live! With Regis and Kelly! Reportedly, they had some drama every now and then, however, they worked together for approximately a decade until Regis finally left in 2011.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>Sources say they managed to keep in touch following his departure, and in many ways, their relationship got stronger because they no longer worked together.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGebmrmtxYyroKmZXZrFsbjAoqWsZZikxG6%2BxKCgrGWgnbatrsinZK2ZpZy1tXnHnqlmrJiaeqq5z6iprZmemLJuu8VmmZ6hnpx6urvUq6qepJZigXN9mG9waA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
