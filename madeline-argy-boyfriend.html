The social media personality might be taking time to move on from her recent heartbreak. As an influencer, she is known for her aesthetic, fashion, and content, and she has been posting about herself on Instagram, where you can still see many comments about her past relationships and someone even asking her to give them a chance to date her.</p><p>So it's not that she doesn't have anyone; she has several people who have a crush on her and are willing to date her, but she is now focused on herself, not wanting a relationship or maybe waiting for someone who truly loves her. Well, we hope she finds her perfect boyfriend or girlfriend soon, as she is bisexual.</p><h2>Madeline Argy and Her Ex-boyfriend Are No Longer Together; Relationship Details!</h2><p>More than wondering about <strong>Madeline Argy</strong>'s boyfriend, fans still wonder about her past relationship with her ex-boyfriend. Taking about their relationship Madeline responded to rumors that she and <strong>Central Cee</strong> were dating on TikTok in September 2022. She said, while sporting a t-shirt that reads, "I [love emoji] lying," "Why does everyone keep asking me whether I'm dating Central Cee? In my entire life, I have never even heard of him. A man who appears to be Central Cee can be seen behind her, rummaging in her kitchen. She was lying, and many of her supporters could tell that she was being a scarcist.</p><p>This seemed to be the couple's method of expressing their commitment to one another. Central Cee and Madeline Argy remained silent about their connection even after appearing to confirm it. Although they virtually never mentioned one another on social media, a fan did manage to photograph them huddled up at a party in March 2023. Fans only needed to see this to understand that they were still going strong.</p><p>Central Cee ultimately placed his lady online in June 2023. In a TikTok video, Central Cee and Madeline can be seen dancing while Central takes the chain off of her neck and puts it around his own. They are both wearing tracksuits. The clip depicts the pair cuddling up close and affectionately together at the end of the video. It appeared that things were taking a serious turn when Central Cee stated in an interview with British Vogue that he shared ownership of Madeline's dog. A fan posted a TikTok the following month that had numerous images of Central Cee and Madeline together.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebsindepth.com/storage/2023/09/madeline-argy-boyfriend-central-cee.jpg alt="Madeline Argy and central Cee were an adorable couple. celebsindepth.com" width=1375 height=720 sizes="(max-width: 1375px) 100vw, 1375px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><strong>Madeline Argy and central Cee were an adorable couple.<br></strong><strong>Source: Distaractify</strong></p><p>Sadly, as per <a href=# rel=noopener>Distractify</a>, as of 2023, the relationship between British rapper Central Cee and model Madeline Argy is over and they are no longer together.
