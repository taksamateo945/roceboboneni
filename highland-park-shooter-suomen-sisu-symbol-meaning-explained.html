They claim that the term should not be translated, but if it is, it literally translates to “Finnish spunk,” “grit,” or “resilience.” Sisu, a major idea in Finnish culture, emphasizes the importance of inner strength.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Archive of his roblox account <a href=#>#HighlandPark</a> <a href=#>#Illinois</a> <a href=#>#RobertECrimoIII</a> <a href=#>https://t.co/BJvzJvGSHj</a></p><p>— ?

Given that Crimo seems to be a strong enthusiast of the number four and its significance, this explanation might have some merit.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr><a href=#>@gal_suburban</a> <a href=#>@clayberg</a> I identified the symbol Robert Crimo used everywhere.</p><p>It it Apotropaic symbol known as the "Cross of Endlessness".</p><p>/1 <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/poz38CihY4</a></p><p>— Miles (@mileszim) <a href=#>July 5, 2022</a></p><p>He had four tally marks with a strike through them tattooed on his cheek and the number 47 (whose significance we detailed in a separate piece) on his temple.</p><p>We cannot infer any overlap because Crimo’s symbol and Suomen Sisu’s differed slightly.
