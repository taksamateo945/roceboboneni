Will Smith told Jimmy Kimmel on Wednesday, Feb. 25, that his technique at good parenting backfired when he asked his Fresh Prince of Bel-Air costar Alfonso Ribeiro to teach his oldest son Trey how to drive.
The Focus actor, 46, first explained on Jimmy Kimmel Live how his second oldest child, Jaden, recently turned 16 and got his learner’s permit. “We have the little golf carts,” Smith said of teaching the kids how to drive."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

So Trey goes and he takes all the lessons, and he learns how to catch the car if it drifts and slides.”</p><p>His grand scheme, however, was a bust. “Then, I get a call from the pastor of the church,” Smith shared, “that he was doing donuts in the church parking lot! This is a lesson to the parents: Do not educate your kids.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all"><p>Years down the line, Uncle Will might have to return the favor as Ribeiro is currently expecting his second child with wife <strong>Angela Unkrich</strong>. The DWTS winner attended Tuesday’s Hollywood premiere of Focus with his pregnant wife, and updated <strong><a href=#>Us Weekly</a></strong> and other reporters on how they’re prepping.</p><p>“I do whatever [my wife] tells me,” Ribeiro, 43, told <strong>Us</strong>. “I do whatever she tells me. It’s her birthday today. So this morning, a little breakfast in bed, that kind of stuff, just to take care of her, do the things that we’re supposed to do.”</p><p>Watch the funny clip above!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpZ6vo2S7psPSaK6ipJxiwK6106FkmqSWpLu0u4yroJudmae8bsDArp6hrF2ovK9506ucsmWYpMRuwM5mm6uhppp6rrXSrZiknV1nfXKBkW9p</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
