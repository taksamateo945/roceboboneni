He did, however, work on a few albums with other performers. He began his career with the track Make a Play, which was well-received by audiences despite his inexperience in the business. In 2020, the rapper signed with 1017 Records and released another song under the label, SolcyBoyz, in 2021. This was followed by the second and third portions of the single. Scarr’s debut mixtape, Big Grim Reaper, was released in April of last year. It peaked at number one on the Billboard 200. Frozone, I Would Keep Goin’, Traphouse, and Joe Dirt are among his other big songs.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Big-Scarr.jpg alt="Big Scarr" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>He also appeared as a guest on the album Love Me Like I’m Dead.

However, the year was not as successful for the hip-hop business, since it saw the loss of many outstanding musicians.&nbsp;Takeoff, who was killed last month, was the most recent victim. The event occurred at a bowling alley in Texas, and by the time police arrived, the artist had died. A nurse from a local hospital had already arrived on the scene. Two additional people had non-life-threatening injuries.&nbsp;Other names on the list include Young Slo-Be, JayDaYoungan, Rollie Bands, Money Gang Vontae, FBG Cash, Trouble, Hypo, Snootie Wild, and others.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGiZop9dqLCivtFmp5qro5qxbq3WmrBmmaRiwamxjJqenmWfm3pzfo4%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
