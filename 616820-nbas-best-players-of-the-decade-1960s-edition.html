Jerry Lucas</strong></p><p><strong></strong>Jerry Lucas was drafted by the Cincinnati Royals, where he played throughout the 1960s.&nbsp; The Royals started Lucas in their frontcourt immediately during his rookie season in 1963-1964.&nbsp;</p><p>As a rookie, Lucas led the league in field goal percentage, shooting 52.7 percent from the field.&nbsp; Not surprisingly, he won the NBA Rookie of the Year.&nbsp; In his second season, Lucas won the All-Star Game MVP in his first of six All-Star Game appearances during the decade.</p><p>The 6'8" big man was one of the best rebounders of all time, averaging 15.6 rebounds per game over his career.&nbsp; That ranks him in the top five rebounders in NBA history.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>9. Elgin Baylor&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong></strong>Elgin Baylor played his prime years during the 1960s as a member of the Los Angeles Lakers.&nbsp; At 6'5", he was an undersized forward who absolutely dominated throughout the decade.</p><p>Baylor was selected to the All-Star team in every year of the decade, except for 1966.&nbsp; He was also a First Team All-NBA player in every year of the 1960s. &nbsp;</p><p>Even though Baylor was small for his position, this did not stop him from rebounding with the best.&nbsp; He frequently finished in the top 10 for rebounds per game, and he ranks ninth all time in the NBA with 13.5 rebounds per game. &nbsp;</p><p>In addition to his rebounding, Baylor often ranked in the top 10 for assists and points per game.&nbsp; He was an all-around great player.</p><p><strong>8. Bob Pettit&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong></strong>Pettit is the only player to rank in the top 10 during both the 1950s (fourth) and 1960s.&nbsp; He retired after the 1965 season, but he was only 32 years old.&nbsp; This meant his peak years came during the 1960s. &nbsp;</p><p>Pettit was recognized as one of the best players in the league, as his honors can validate: an All-Star selection every year he played and a First Team All-NBA selection every year except his last. &nbsp;</p><p>In addition, the 6'9" big man ranks amongst the all-time greats in points per game (seventh) and rebounds per game (third).</p><p><strong>7. Sam Jones&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong></strong>Sam Jones was a career Celtic, where he was a hybrid guard/forward for their dynasty.&nbsp; Of the 10 NBA Championships during the 1960s, the Celtics won nine of them.&nbsp; Sam Jones was a team member for all of them. &nbsp;</p><p>Thanks mainly to Bill Russell, Jones was never the best player on the Celtics, but he was the number two guy for most of their rings.&nbsp;</p><p>Sam Jones was an overshadowed player during the decade, as he had to compete with Jerry West and Oscar Robertson for awards.&nbsp; As a result, he was only selected to five All-Star games and was never a First-Team All-NBA player; although, he was chosen for the Second Team three times.</p><p><strong>6. Walt Bellamy&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong></strong>Bellamy was frequently on the move during the 1960s.&nbsp; In total, he played in four different cities.</p><p>Despite the frequent change of uniforms, Bellamy was a force to be reckoned with no matter where he was playing.&nbsp; After being selected first overall by the Chicago Packers in the 1961 NBA Draft, Bellamy instantly became a star.&nbsp; He won the Rookie of the Year in 1962, playing the best year of his career.&nbsp; During Bellamy's rookie campaign, he scored 31.6 points and grabbed 19.0 rebounds per game, while leading the league with a 51.9 percent field goal percentage.&nbsp; As a result, Bellamy was awarded Rookie of the Year honors.</p><p>Unfortunately for Bellamy, he played center during a decade dominated by two other centers: Bill Russell and Wilt Chamberlain.&nbsp; This meant Bellamy was all but shut out for awards.&nbsp; He was selected to four All-Star Games, but he was never an All-NBA player. &nbsp;</p><p><strong>5. Bailey Howell&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong></strong>When people think of the 1960s, 6'7" forward Bailey Howell does not often come to mind first.&nbsp; Nonetheless, he should.</p><p>When Bill Russell began to decline in his final two years, Bailey Howell stepped in as the best player on the Celtics' final two Championships of the decade.</p><p>Throughout his career, Howell was a 20-point and 10-rebound per game player.&nbsp; As well, he was a six-time All Star. &nbsp;<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>4. Bill Russell&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong></strong>While he did not contribute significantly on the offensive end, Bill Russell was the best defensive player to ever step on to an NBA court.&nbsp; During the 1960s, Russell was in the top three in rebounding per game every single year, leading the league twice.</p><p>In addition to his rebounding prowess, Russell was a solid passing big man.&nbsp; He was in the top 10 in the league for assists per game four times during the decade.</p><p>Perhaps most impressively, Russell was a major reason the Boston Celtics were able to win nine NBA Championships during the decade. &nbsp;</p><p>Russell was bestowed numerous honors during the decade.&nbsp; These included 10 All-Star selections, four NBA MVPs, one All-Star Game MVP, two First-Team All-NBA selections and seven Second-Team All-NBA selections.&nbsp; Unfortunately, the NBA did not start awarding All-Defensive Team honors until Russell's final season.&nbsp; Unsurprisingly, he was selected to the First Team.</p><p><strong>3. Jerry West&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong></strong>Unlike the 1950s, the 1960s had two guards who were amongst the best during the decade: Jerry West and Oscar Robertson.&nbsp; West spend the 1960s as the leader for the Los Angeles Lakers and one of the best offensive players of the decade.</p><p>Amongst the all-time best, West ranks near the top.&nbsp; He ranks fifth all time in points per game, 35th in assists per game and was frequently one of the most efficient scorers in the game.</p><p>During the 1960s, West made nine All-Star Games and six First-Team All-NBA selections.&nbsp; Had West played in the 1950s or 1970s, he would have been the best guard of the decade.&nbsp; However, that honor belongs to the next man on the list.</p><p><strong>2. Oscar Robertson</strong></p><p><strong></strong>The Big O spent the 1960s with the Cincinnati Royals.&nbsp; This meant limited postseason success, but that was in spite of Robertson's tremendous play.</p><p>Robertson was everything a team could want in a guard.&nbsp; He scored 30 points per game throughout the 1960s, leading the league in scoring once.&nbsp; As well, he led the league in assists per game seven times during the decade.&nbsp; In his career, Robertson averaged 9.5 assists per game, ranking fourth all time.&nbsp; During his first few seasons in the league, Robertson even averaged double-digit rebounds per game. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Oscar Robertson was widely recognized as the best guard of the decade.&nbsp; He was selected to nine All-Star Games, winning the game's MVP three times, won Rookie of the Year and won the 1964 NBA MVP.&nbsp; In addition, Robertson was a nine-time All-NBA First-Team selection.</p><p><strong>1. Wilt Chamberlain</strong></p><p><strong></strong>Wilt the Stilt was heads and shoulders above everyone else in the NBA during the 1960s, in terms of both height (7'1") and play.&nbsp; He was Bill Russell with a dominant offensive game.</p><p>During the decade, Wilt led the league seven times in field goal percentage, eight times in rebounds per game and seven times in points per game.</p><p>This led to him being an All-Star every season of the 1960s and a First-Team All-NBA player seven times.&nbsp; As well, he won four NBA MVPs, including one during his rookie season where he also won the Rookie of the Year award and All-Star Game MVP.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJobWpuaGd9brrBmqpmmpWowW68y5qwnqqjYrynedOhnGaclZiupbGManBvaKNisqW106Kmpw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
