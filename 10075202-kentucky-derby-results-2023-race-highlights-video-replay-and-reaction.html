He's been an incredibly successful jockey with multiple Eclipse Awards and two wins in the Preakness but a Derby win had previously eluded him.</p><p>He was confident in his horse despite the longer odds.</p><p>"I had a lot of confidence in myself this year would be the year. I thought this year would be the year," he said, per <a href=# rel=noopener>news release</a> from the Kentucky Derby. "This horse was unbelievable today."</p><p>Castellano now has a major accomplishment on his already impressive resume.</p><p>The attention soon shifts to whether he can win another Preakness with this mount. Mage certainly appeared to have the speed to be a factor at Pimlico if his connections are interested in running the colt.</p><p>The potential to also have Forte show up at that race on May 20 presents an intriguing second leg of the Triple Crown.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGloZ2p%2FcX6MpJynrKWYuLp5w56pm7Fdp7K0wcutqmZqYGeAbr7AnJxmoJmcta21xqGrrGWmnrGmu4yrnKmkka56orrDZqmemZOptrC6</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
