The event planner was born on the 10th of October, 1987, and is now 36 years old. Her star sign is Libra. Not much is known about Melissa’s background, but it is reported that she is an African-American woman.</p><p>Because of how limited the information about her family is, the identity of Melissa’s parents has remained a mystery, however, according to our findings, Melissa Heholt is not an only child; she is the eldest child in her family.</p><p>She is reported to have three younger siblings. But, the identities of her siblings remain vague. It is also not clear what they are up to at the moment.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzzsouthafrica.com/us/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2023/04/melissa1.jpg><p>Although there isn’t much information available about her early life and family background, what is known is that Melissa and her family moved away from New York to New Jersey shortly after she was born. So, she spent most of her childhood in the beautiful state of New Jersey, where she formed many of her fondest memories.</p><p>It is believed that growing up with three younger siblings, Melissa learned the importance of responsibility and the value of family. Some reports say she was hands-on with her siblings when they were left in her care by their mother. Also, any time the family had gatherings in the house, she was always among those in charge of getting things done, including cooking and serving.</p><p>Apparently, her upbringing in New Jersey instilled in her a strong work ethic and a determination to succeed, which would serve her well in her future endeavors.</p><h3><strong>Melissa Heholt’s Education</strong></h3><p>Melissa is an incredibly well-educated individual with an impressive academic background. It is not clear where she had her elementary education. However, we know she received her secondary education at the prestigious Archbishop Molloy High School, located in the bustling city of New York. After completing her secondary education, she enrolled at St. John’s University, also in New York, to further her studies.</p><p>While in college, Melissa initially pursued a degree in Education, but she later decided to change courses and shifted to studying Health Administration, eventually graduating with a bachelor’s degree in health administration. In addition to this, Melissa later returned to school to study for a master’s degree in elementary education.</p><p>Some reports say she has two bachelor’s degrees in addition to her master’s degree. But this claim has not been independently verified. What is clear is that she has always been a very huge believer in education.</p><h2><strong>How Did J. Cole and Melissa Heholt Meet?</strong></h2><p>Melissa Heholt and J. Cole have a long and fascinating history together. Interestingly, they attended the same college – St. John’s College in New York. It was while studying at the college that they first crossed.</p><p>According to our findings, J. Cole initially pursued a degree in computer science at St. Johns. However, he later decided to switch his major to communications, a decision that would ultimately pave the way for his successful music career.</p><p>Details about how exactly they first met remain unclear. However, we know that the couple’s romance began to blossom during their university years in the early 2000s. At the time, J. Cole was still a relatively unknown artist, and their relationship remained lowkey. However, their bond continued to grow stronger as they supported each other’s dreams and aspirations.</p><p>Despite facing various challenges along the way, the couple’s love for each other never wavered. They dated for almost a decade before finally tying the knot and making their love official.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzzsouthafrica.com/us/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2023/04/melissa2.jpg><h2><strong>When Did Melissa Become J. Cole’s Wife?</strong></h2><p>Melissa Heholt and J. Cole’s relationship has always been shrouded in secrecy. Both individuals are notoriously private about their personal lives, and they have managed to keep most of their union away from the public eye.&nbsp;One of the most significant mysteries surrounding the couple is when exactly they got married.</p><p>In 2014, rumors emerged that Melissa and J. Cole had gotten engaged. However, the couple did not confirm nor deny the rumors. Eventually, the couple got married in a very secret ceremony. It was so secret that no outsider knew about it, and no entertainment news outlet reported it.</p><p>The couple kept the details of their nuptials a closely guarded secret. It is surprising that even with J. Cole’s immense fame, the couple managed to keep this information from getting to the public.</p><p>It was only in 2016 that news of their wedding emerged. According to our findings, during a 2016 interview with Ryan Coogler, the director of the highly acclaimed Black Panther movie, the news about Melissa’s marriage to J. Cole was accidentally revealed. During the interview, Coogler made an inadvertent mistake by revealing J. Cole and Melissa Heholt’s marital status.</p><p>Coogler made the mistake of asking J. Cole about how getting married had “changed” him. When he realized his blunder, Coogler immediately apologized and explained that he had never conducted an interview before.</p><p>J. Cole, known for his composed and collected nature, took the situation calmly and replied, “That was like one thing to not do. But it’s all good… They know now.” The revelation caused a stir among fans and the media as people wondered how he could have kept his wedding away from the prying eyes of the media.</p><p>But, despite the unintended revelation of their marriage, J. Cole and Melissa have remained tight-lipped about their marriage, insisting to keep it private. Also, very little is still known about the specifics of their big day, including when it happened and exactly when it took place. Many reports suggest that they got married in 2015.</p><h3><strong>Melissa’s Husband, J. Cole Is One Of The World’s Greatest Rappers</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzzsouthafrica.com/us/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2023/04/j-cole.jpg><p>Melissa Heholt’s husband has become one of the most successful rappers of his time. He is also a songwriter and record producer and is known for his introspective lyrics, storytelling ability, and smooth delivery. He has become one of the most critically acclaimed and commercially successful rappers of his generation.

Cole are not only private about their marital lives but are also very private about their children. Even though they became parents for the first time soon after they got married, they somehow managed to keep the birth of their children under wraps and away from the prying eyes of the media for some time.</p><p>It was only during an interview with radio host Angie Martinez in May 2018 that J. Cole made a rare mention of their child. He revealed that he and Melissa had welcomed a son together but did not disclose any further details about the child or when he was born. This revelation surprised fans who were not aware that J. Cole and Melissa had become parents.</p><p>The couple remained silent about their son until 2019, when J. Cole opened up a little more about the boy. This happened during an interview with GQ magazine, where he shared some insights into his personal life. He mentioned that fatherhood had changed him in many ways and that he now sees the world in a different light. He also said Melissa is doing a wonderful job as a mother.</p><p>Then, on July 20, 2020, during a surprise announcement for his new album, “The Fall Off,” J. Cole <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">revealed</a> that he and Melissa had welcomed another son and that now they have two sons. But he did not disclose the date of birth of the boy or any other details about the child. The announcement still came as a surprise to many fans who were unaware that J. Cole had another child.</p><p>Melissa Heholt and J. Cole love their personal lives as private as possible. Today, nothing else is known about Melissa’s private life with her family except when she or her husband willingly come out to speak about it. For now, we know that the couple has two sons whom they adore. However, not much is known about how they are being raised or what schools they attend.</p><p>This notwithstanding, it is certain that the two sons of the couple, who were born with a silver spoon, are being raised with all the affection and privilege that money can afford, considering the kind of family they were born into.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzzsouthafrica.com/us/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2023/04/Melissa.jpg><h2><strong>Melissa Heholt Used To Be A Teacher</strong></h2><p>Melissa Heholt used to work as a teacher. She developed a love for teaching from a young age, and this was evident when she was little, as she often taught some of the smaller children. However, her journey to becoming a teacher was not straightforward. After graduating from high school, Melissa enrolled at St. John’s University in New York with a major in Education.</p><p>However, she faced discouragement from others who told her that teaching did not pay well and that if she studied Education, she would not get good jobs after school. In the following months, Melissa, who was already confused, changed her major a few times, first to business administration and then to health administration. She eventually graduated with a bachelor’s degree in health administration.</p><p>But, even after graduating with a degree in health administration, she found that the jobs she took were unfulfilling. She got a few jobs but was frustrated with what she had to do.&nbsp;Realizing that she had made a mistake by not following her passion to study Education and teach, Melissa went back to school to pursue a Master’s degree in elementary education.</p><p>Melissa excelled in her studies, and when she got her master’s degree, she landed a teaching job in a school. Her natural talent for teaching became apparent as she enjoyed her time in the classroom, impacting her students positively. Unfortunately, despite her love for teaching, Melissa eventually grew frustrated with the state of the US education system and the lack of support for teachers.</p><p>As a result, she made the tough decision to resign and pursue other opportunities. It is a decision that she has never regretted.</p><h2><strong>She is Now an Event Planner and has Her Own Company</strong></h2><p>After Melissa Heholt made the life-changing decision to leave her career as a teacher, she decided to pursue her passion for event planning. According to reports, when she quit teaching, Melissa took some time to do a thorough soul-searching about what she wanted to do with her life. She eventually realized that event planning was her true passion</p><p>It turned out that throughout her life, Melissa had always been the person her family, friends, and collegiate organizations turned to for special event planning. With her natural talent for organizing and coordinating, she became known as the go-to girl for creating memorable experiences in the past for her family. Also, her background in education and health administration gave her a unique perspective on how to provide a personalized and detailed event planning service.</p><p>With encouragement from family and friends, Melissa decided to start her own company.&nbsp;In 2014, Melissa established her own event planning company, which she named Statice Events. The company’s mission is to offer an intimate and personalized event-planning experience that actively involves clients throughout the planning process from beginning to finish.</p><p>Today, Statice Events has grown to become a successful event-planning company that offers a wide range of services, including weddings, corporate events, and social gatherings.</p><h3><strong>She Is The Executive Director of The Dreamville Foundation</strong></h3><p>In addition to being a successful event planner and entrepreneur, Melissa Heholt is also a passionate philanthropist and community leader. She now serves as the executive director of the Dreamville Foundation, a charity organization that was founded by her husband, J. Cole.</p><p>The foundation aims to uplift young people and provide them with resources to achieve their dreams. Melissa’s involvement in the foundation highlights her deep commitment to empowering the youth and making a positive impact on society.</p><p>Based in Fayetteville, North Carolina, the Dreamville Foundation has been making a meaningful impact on the lives of young people in the community for over a decade. Through programs such as the Dreamville Festival, which brings together music, art, and culture to inspire creativity and entrepreneurship, and the Dreamville Scholarship Program, which supports high school seniors in pursuit of higher education, the organization is helping to create a brighter future for young people in the area.</p><p>Apart from being an event planner and philanthropist, Melissa also loves to explore. Our findings show that in her free time, Melissa enjoys exploring new cultures through travel, experimenting with new recipes in the kitchen, and indulging her love of fashion and shopping. Recently, she has discovered a new passion for florals and has taken an apprenticeship with Makini Regal Designs, a leading floral design company, to expand her knowledge and skills in this area.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiapa%2FHtLvUrZ%2BanqKesKJ6wqikaK2jZMSpu4yiqmallaG2tL%2FAZp%2BeoJ%2BhwW6ty6VkmpqfqsFutoycpqWdo2LEqrLEZqqippOaenN8kG5m</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
