Kathryn was the one to shut it down, stating that age is not an issue for her, and saying that she has always had a liking for older men. Kathryn was fascinated by Rush and called their relationship amazing.</p><p>Kathryn Adams Limbaugh and husband Rush Limbaugh got married on <strong>5 June 2010</strong> in Palm Beach, Florida in an Hawaiian-themed ceremony with 400 guests attending – Elton John was invited to perform his classic hits at the wedding.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/affairpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/rushkathryn2a-e1545692054925-1.jpg><p>The couple went to places like Mexico and on various islands trip on Rush’s private jet right after the wedding.

Divorce?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>After seven years of marriage, Rush came to know via a news article that Kathryn had been&nbsp;cheating on him&nbsp;with several younger men. In June 2018 Radar Online released a news article, alleging affairs even with a young married man, and with an athlete but none named.</p><p>The news shook the radio hot head Rush Limbaugh and angered him enough to cut off most of her privileges. ‘Rush was stunned and humiliated upon hearing the news’, stated a close friend of his. Kathryn had allegedly been two-timing Rush for several years, but despite the constant news about her cheating, Rush initially decided to ignore the situation as he is ‘too afraid to lose her’.</p><p>Kathryn and Rush’s marriage did not have a pre-nuptial agreement done, so if they are to get divorced, a large amount of Rush’s property is at stake, and Kathryn may win a considerable sum.</p><p>Kathryn has been banned from using her husband’s private jet and nowadays is apparently living with her mother in luxury hotels in New York and Boston.</p><p>After the news of cheating broke out, her husband hired a team of detectives to spy on and gather proof against Kathryn.
