The aspiring actress looked radiant (and all grown up!) at L.A.'s Four Seasons Hotel on Friday, Oct. 4, when she celebrated her Sweet 16 with a lavish birthday party thrown by her famous parents, <a href=#><strong>Heather Locklear</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Richie Sambora</strong></a>.</p><p>Divorced since 2007, the Melrose Place alum, 52, and her Bon Jovi guitarist ex, 54, happily posed for pictures inside the bash with their not-so-little girl, who stunned in a white cutout dress. All three appeared genuinely glad to be there together and in great spirits.</p><p>In fact, Locklear and Sambora have become very friendly since ending their 13-year marriage six years ago. Last year, Sambora told Access Hollywood Live that the two were in "a great place" in their relationship.&nbsp;</p><p>"We're very good. It's actually even beyond for [our daughter's] sake," he said, noting that they "go out all the time" as a family. "Heather and I really respect each other, and we've become better friends, I think, now that we're not married."&nbsp;</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Ava, for her part, has really come into her own over the last few years. In 2012, she made her feature-film debut in the<strong> Judd Apatow</strong> comedy This Is 40, starring <a href=#><strong>Paul Rudd</strong></a>, <strong>Leslie Mann</strong>, and <a href=#><strong>Megan Fox</strong></a> (among others). "It was an amazing experience," she told <a href=#>Teen Vogue</a> recently of appearing in the Knocked Up sequel. "Everyone was so welcoming."</p><p>"Ever since I was five or six, I've wanted to be an actress," she explained. "I loved attention and would always try to be onstage and in front of people. It was easy to figure out what I wanted to be."</p><p>"I really only get nervous in front of my family and friends, because I want to impress them," Ava added. "I'm very on top of it with people I don't know."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpZ6vo2S7psPSaJ%2BemaSdsrN5y6iapKSVlr9uvsicn6KdXaiurq7Oq5hmqpWqu6rAxGadqKpdma62s8etnKtlkauutHnSsJyerF1mg26uyKuroZyRrnqxrdGtsGaomZjBtr7EZmlpaWNmfXJ8</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
