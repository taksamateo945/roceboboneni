He keeps on doing</h3><p class=align-left>It is human nature and folly to think that God gets tired of helping his people. Was there a time when you sought his help and thought all was done and that you were asking too much? If so, then you need to listen to Dube’s song <i>He Keeps on Doing</i> to remind you that God does not tire – he keeps on helping us no matter how sinful we are.</p><p></p><p class=align-left>It resonates well with this illustration; go ahead and ask for God’s help the number of times you need it – he will be there to do respond.

I’ll rise again</h3><p class=align-left>Everybody has that moment in life when they fall but what do you do when you fall? Of course, you do not stay down – you rise. This is an encouragement song. Benjamin encourages his fans and listeners to find support in God to rise every time they fall.</p><p></p><p class=align-left>This song sets you in the praise and worship mood. <strong><i>I’ll Rise Again</i></strong>, is a powerful song that glorifies the role of God in our life; he makes us whole, strong, comforts us, and helps us rise again whenever we fall.</p><h3>14.
