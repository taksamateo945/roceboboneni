The queen of RHOA debunked the rumor and recently revealed who reached out to her when the news broke.</p><p>While chatting on the couch with Real Housewives superfan Jerry O’ Conell, Williams interrupted the interview to say that Leakes texted her that she was quitting.</p><p>In a tearful plea, Wendy asked her friend through the screen to stay on the show and not let the drama get to her. She also revealed that Nene had a ‘secret’ that would melt fan’s hearts.</p><p>The Glee alum explained to her followers that that was a private text sent out of frustration to her friend and she never intended for it to see the light of day.</p><p>During the latest RHOA after show, Leakes spoke even more about that specific situation.</p><p></p><p>‘When all this stuff came out&nbsp; ‘Nene’s gonna quit the show’ Porsha, Tanya, Marlo — they all on my phone like talking to me to make sure I’m okay. If they didn’t care, they wouldn’t call me and pick up the phone and be like ‘What’s going on? We need to talk. Can I come over?’ You know, they were all on my phone but that is a form of sisterhood because we do work together but if they didn’t really care or had some concern.. they all picked up the phone.’</p><p>As for Kandi Burruss, she and Kenya Moore aren’t in agreement with the others about this so-called ‘sisterhood.’</p><p>Burruss told producers: ‘Everybody say it’s a sisterhood but that sisterhood is so fake.’</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>The ladies will hash out this debate and more during the upcoming reunion teleconference. Do you think the ladies’ sisterhood is genuine?</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGeinbyiec2epZ5lnJqurLHSZqmerpWWubR51qGmZqqVlrCpscNmpq6sXam8brTEq2SapZmZerPBzKiprGWjnbJuw8CsZKqtmanBqrrGZquhnV2otbDDjGxvbnFlanw%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
