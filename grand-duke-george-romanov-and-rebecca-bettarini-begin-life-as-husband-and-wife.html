class=mol-para-with-font>The Romanovs enjoyed a life of seemingly endless prosperity and ruled of a sixth of the surface of the Earth in the early 20th century.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The family fortunes soared when Anastasia Zakharyina married Ivan IV (the Terrible), the Rurikid Grand Prince of Moscow, on 3 February 1547.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Since her husband had assumed the title of tsar on 16 January 1547, she was crowned the very first tsaritsa of Russia.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Her mysterious death in 1560 changed Ivan’s character for the worse. Suspecting the boyars of having poisoned his beloved, Tsar Ivan started a reign of terror against them.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Among his children by Anastasia, the elder (Ivan) was murdered by the tsar in a quarrel; the younger Feodor, a pious but lethargic prince, inherited the throne upon his father’s death in 1584.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Their&nbsp;Romanov dynasty lasted 300 years: the lives of its tsars and emperors and empresses is a bejewelled but bloodsplattered chronicle of assassinations, adulteries, tortures, secret marriages, coups, reckless rises and brutal falls.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>It is peopled by heroic, brilliant statesmen, soldiers and reformers – as well as nymphomaniacs, martinets, murderers, blunderers, monsters, megalomaniacs and lunatics.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Under the Romanovs between 1613 and 1917, Russia was an empire of oppressed nations dominated by one family and a tiny Russian nobility.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Its system was a paranoid, hereditary autocracy which was ‘tempered by assassination’ as one commentator puts it.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>In 1742,&nbsp;Empress Elizabeth of Russia brought Anna Petrovn’s son, her nephew Peter of Holstein-Gottorp, to St. Petersburg and proclaimed him her heir. In time, she married him off to a German princess, Sophia of Anhalt-Zerbst.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>In 1762, shortly after the death of Empress Elizabeth, Sophia, who had taken the Russian name Catherine upon her marriage, overthrew her unpopular husband, with the aid of her lover, Grigory Orlov. She reigned as Catherine the Great.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Alexander II became the next Russian emperor in 1855, in the midst of the Crimean War. While Alexander considered it his charge to maintain peace in Europe and Russia, he believed only a strong Russian military could keep the peace.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>By developing the army, giving some freedom to Finland, and freeing the serfs in 1861 he gained much popular support.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Despite his popularity, however, his family life began to unravel by the mid 1860s.
