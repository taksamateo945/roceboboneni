For over 16 years, Gabe Solis was an essential part of our lives,” Braxton wrote on Instagram accompanied by a photo of herself, Solis and her two sons. “Like all families, there are good and bad moments that are endured, but those moments, good or bad still made us who we are in the present. Unfortunately, someone leaked the story before we could make everyone aware of his passing, and I apologize to those friends and family members for finding out through social outlets. I also apologize directly to the Solis Family.</p><p>“I do humbly ask for your prayers for our families, but my greatest request is that when you are posting comments, remember Gabe’s passing is a loss for our family,” Braxton added. “He was a father to my boys, a son, brother, and friend to many and I would appreciate privacy and respect as we grieve his unexpected departure. @gabe_solis1234 I miss you, my dear friend.”</p><p>She did not disclose Solis’ cause of death, but TMZ&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener>reported</a>&nbsp;Friday that the 43-year-old died after battling cancer in Texas. He is said to have been surrounded by family and friends. The outlet also said Solis’ health was kept quiet, leading his death to surprise many.</p><p>Ahead of her confirmation, fans had already&nbsp;begun flooding her Instagram comments with condolences.</p><p>“I’m truly shocked! May he RIP. @trinabraxton1 stay strong & my deepest condolences for you, the boys, and his family🙏🏽❤️”</p><p>“My condolences to you and your family.”</p><p>“Hang in [there] Trina.”</p><p>Despite the pair’s split three years ago, Braxton’s and Solis’ relationship was a staple of “<a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Braxton Family Values</strong></a>.” As the two raised&nbsp;the singer’s sons together, they remained friends and appeared on “<a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Iyanla Fix My Life</strong></a>.” There, they reflected on their troubles, including Solis’ accusations that his ex-wife was verbally abusive.</p><p>Presently, fans have been doing as Braxton asked and offering their support and prayers.</p><p>“God bless. Prayers for Gabe’s family, you and your boys. 💞”</p><p>“Im so sorry for ya’ll loss 😢😢😢praying for ya’ll 🙏🙏🙏”</p><p>“Oh my sweet Trina. I am so sorry for your loss. I pray Gabe is resting at peace.
