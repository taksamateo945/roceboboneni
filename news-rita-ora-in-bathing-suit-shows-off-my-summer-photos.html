"I had my therapist on the phone with me today, at midday. We were talking for an hour. I don't know how I could function without therapy." It's a topic she's included in the lyrics to a new song she's been recording recently. She recites it for me. "You can't move forward without learning how to forgive/ I went through therapy…" She stops and starts to hum the melody to remember the line. "I went through therapy to learn how to heal…"</span></p><p><span>Rita is a fan of AMRAP (as many reps as possible) workouts. Her trainer Wade Farmer shared a clip of her workout on his Instagram Story in which she tackles three moves. The exercise method is great for keeping your heartrate up and challenging you to get in as many reps as possible in the given time.&nbsp;</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/09/GettyImages-1406985873.jpg><p><span>Rita told </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external nofollow" href=#><span>Shape</span></a><span> that she also does circuit training. "I usually work out for one or two hours, depending on how much time I have. I do three circuits and repeat that three times. I mostly focus on my thighs and my bum, so I do a lot of squats and weight lifting. And I do one circuit of cardio."</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/09/GettyImages-1241925633.jpg><p><span>Rita has a healthy motivation to stay in shape. "I didn't start working out to get skinnier. I started working out to feel better," she told </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external nofollow" href=#><span>Shape,</span></a><span> "And I think it's important for women to know that. Don't be obsessed with being thin. You just have to be fit, healthy, and strong."</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo8PEpaNnm5%2BifK%2Bx1qxkq6GklnqwvsBmoKdlkpbBqbXNoGSsrZmperS0zrCqZqeWm3quxYysrKallad6sbTOraasZw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
