So I took it as a huge compliment and thought it was super cool.”</p><p><strong>Chrishell </strong>revealed that after him tweeting at her that he was in the market to buy, she messaged him back and asked if he’d like to be part of the show.</p><p>“I said, ‘Listen, I understand this can be a question that you ignore, but I absolutely have to ask if you’d be willing to film this on the show, but no pressure, I’ll help you either way.’ That’s how I approach it with any celebs that I’ve worked with in the seasons you’re about to see. I just put it on their plate and try not to pressure them at all and just say, ‘It’s totally up to you, I’ll work with you no matter what.’ But he was so enthusiastic about it!”</p><p>She added that <strong>Simu </strong>was “such a pro. There’s certain times with production, where maybe it works better for his schedule to go on this day, but we don’t have the location to shoot until this day, but he was just such a love.”</p><p>“Normally, I have extra on my plate when I’m working with a celebrity and I’m trying to cater to them, but also need to cater to production and the limits that we have with filming, but he was just so lovely and so helpful,” <strong>Chrishell </strong>shared. “I am so excited. I mean, he’s obviously blown up since then. He was already there, but now I’ll be driving down the street and there he is on the billboard!”</p><p>Selling Sunset season 4 will premiere on November 24.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr xml:lang=en>What no I’m not binge-watching Season 3 of Selling Sunset, why would you think that at all ?</p><p>— Simu Liu (刘思慕) (@SimuLiu) <a href=#>August 10, 2020</a></p><p lang=en dir=ltr xml:lang=en>While I got you… I might be in the market to buy……</p><p>— Simu Liu (刘思慕) (@SimuLiu) <a href=#>April 2, 2021</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue8Snq56qpJa2r7nEp6tom5intrS0xKWjZquklsK0sYydoKyglah6sLqMoZivoZ6cerS1zK5kpaGlYryvedOhnGamlax6tLHArKanZZ%2BberSxy6Wgp59dqMKvv8StZGtn</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
